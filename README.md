# YouTube-Video-Summariser

This project basically generates a summary text of any YouTube video (provided that the video has English transcripts attached with it) with the help of an extension we created and reflects it to the user. It makes use of two Python libraries - transformers & youtube_transcript_api. 

The extension can be added in the Browser and it will start working.
